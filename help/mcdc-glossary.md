Glossary of terms used in the Device Co-op.

**Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op**

The program is a group of brands, all Adobe customers, who have agreed to share data about which devices consumers use so as to better identity an individual across devices and deliver more meaningful, consistent experiences. The technology that results will be a core service of the Experience Cloud and will help marketers identify customers/consumers consistently across channels, solutions, experiences and devices.

**Deterministic Linking**

Links a device to a person based on authentication (e.g., a logon by a person on a device). See [Deterministic and Probabilistic Links](mcdc-processes/mcdc-links.md#concept-58bb7ab25f904f5f98d645e35205c931)

**Device**

In the context of the [!DNL Device Graph], *`device`* has a dual meaning. First, a device is a hardware device such as a tablet, phone, desktop on which other devices run. Second, a device is a mobile, desktop, or other interaction point where a person engages with a brand. Currently, a unique [!DNL Experience Cloud] ID is assigned to a person for each device they use. For example, the same person could engage with a brand from Chrome on their desktop, Firefox on their laptop, and an app on an Android phone. In this case, Chrome, Firefox, and the app are all considered "devices."

**Devices per Person**

See [Device](mcdc-glossary.md#glossentry-5690d9a245634214b91890156e216950).

**Device Advertising ID (DAID)**

An ID unique to each hardware device, to be used for advertising purposes. Usually provided by the manufacturer of the device or device operating system (e.g., IDFA, GAID, Roku ID, Playstation ID).

**Device Graph**

The [!DNL Device Graph] is the set of all people and their associated devices. The Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op generates the [!DNL Device Graph].

**Linking**

Grouping [devices](mcdc-glossary.md#glossentry-5690d9a245634214b91890156e216950) together through their touch-points.

**Probabilistic Linking**

Links a device to a person algorithmically, based on characteristics such as browsing behavior, IP address, operating system. See [Deterministic and Probabilistic Links](mcdc-processes/mcdc-links.md#concept-58bb7ab25f904f5f98d645e35205c931).
